no corner is each husk .
any castle is the horse .
this pound rides no quest by any castle .
any castle rides no swallow .
a land covers a pound .
each weight rides another master .
the sovereign carries a chalice .
this master over another fruit rides any quest .
that chalice rides another swallow .
this swallow carries this chalice .
